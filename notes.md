# Notes

#### To-Do:

-   Researching how to remove duplicate back-to-back name outputs
-   Resarch how to add generated names to a "already selected"-list and maybe even remove them from another "all available students"-list
-   search for a nice font
-   finalize design
-   ???
-   done

#### Maybe do?:

-   change up colors. pretty happy about the current theme but might change them up.

#### Already done:

-   HTML layout
-   working JS code to generate a random name from list
-   SASS code for basic styling (MAYBE finished design?)
-   add mobile layout (doh! was only planned as a Desktop variant but now that I think about it, a mobile version might be nice as well? IDK need to think about it)
-   Button Animations
-   added favicon
-   added cursor pointer on hover to buttons
